Total Devices Detected on LAN: 0

MAC Address Filtering: Likely Enabled

Guest Network: Likely Active (based on subnet/isolation)

WIDS/WIPS Detection: Not Directly Detectable via Script (Requires Enterprise WLC or sensors)

Authentication Mechanism: Ports 802.1X/Radius not directly testable, but check port 1812 (RADIUS) or 443

Firewall Integration: Basic ping & port test included (advanced requires admin router access)
Router Firmware Updates: Cannot be checked without SNMP/HTTP admin access
Network Segmentation: Suggested if LAN device count is zero in shared network
Audit and Logging: Add centralized logging/SIEM in real deployments
Penetration Testing: Manual tools (e.g., nmap, metasploit) needed for deep test
User Awareness Testing: Consider phishing simulations or training platform

Bandwidth Estimate: Based on total devices + signal strength (not accurate without SNMP)
For precise bandwidth & traffic, integrate with SNMP or NetFlow in enterprise setups.

MAC Address Filtering: Not Strict (Duplicates found)

Guest Network: Not Detected

WIDS/WIPS Detection: Cannot detect without Enterprise Wireless Controllers or sensors
Authentication Ports Detected: Checking port 1812 (RADIUS), 443 (HTTPS)

Firewall Integration: ICMP and port scan conducted for all active hosts
Router Firmware Updates: Access denied (requires SNMP or HTTP admin access)
Network Segmentation: LAN Active
Audit & Logging: Not implemented. Recommend forwarding logs to SIEM (e.g., Splunk)
Penetration Testing: Run nmap or metasploit externally for vulnerability assessment
User Awareness Testing: Use simulated phishing (e.g., GoPhish, KnowBe4)

Bandwidth Estimate: Not precise. SNMP/NetFlow required for exact traffic insight.
