Total Devices Detected on LAN: 0

MAC Address Filtering: Likely Enabled

Guest Network: Likely Active (based on subnet/isolation)

WIDS/WIPS Detection: Not Directly Detectable via Script (Requires Enterprise WLC or sensors)

Authentication Mechanism: Ports 802.1X/Radius not directly testable, but check port 1812 (RADIUS) or 443

Firewall Integration: Basic ping & port test included (advanced requires admin router access)
Router Firmware Updates: Cannot be checked without SNMP/HTTP admin access
Network Segmentation: Suggested if LAN device count is zero in shared network
Audit and Logging: Add centralized logging/SIEM in real deployments
Penetration Testing: Manual tools (e.g., nmap, metasploit) needed for deep test
User Awareness Testing: Consider phishing simulations or training platform

Bandwidth Estimate: Based on total devices + signal strength (not accurate without SNMP)
For precise bandwidth & traffic, integrate with SNMP or NetFlow in enterprise setups.
